# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Set up a GitHub repo for tracking. Set a specific goal with a basic plan. Wrote a blog post about it. Found a course on Udemy that also includes quizzes, challenges, and major projects that I can work on to upload to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** It's a little intimidating putting myself out there, but I work best under a little pressure.

### Day 1: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Got through 16 of 110 lectures of the course.
Did some practice exercises to familiarize myself with the concepts.


**Thoughts:**
I wanted to practice with real challenges, but I need to familiarize myself until I cover all of the fundamentals. So, begrudgingly forgiving myself for not practicing real challenges until I get through the fundamentals.

### Day 2: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Got through five more lectures. Now on lecture 22 of 110 course lectures. Coded along and completed exercises and quizzes to test my knowledge. Practiced several examples on my own as well.


**Thoughts:**
I completed fewer lessons than yesterday, so I'm a little bummed about that. In all fairness, though, these lessons were longer and I kept stopping to practice the material.

### Day 3: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Completed six more lectures today. On 29 of 110 now. learned about tuples, which I hadn't encountered before. Also learned about file input and output using Python. Cool stuff : ). Spent time practicing the concepts on my own.


**Thoughts:**
Getting there. Getting there. I need to keep reminding myself that I'm still making progress no matter how slow it might seem.

### Day 4: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Made it through seven lectures today. On 36 of 110 now. Reviewed the previous material and took a self-assessment test. Then, learned how control flow & loops (for & while) work in Python.


**Thoughts:**
Finally getting to the fun stuff! I might be able to make start working on challenges soon! Can't wait. : )

### Day 5: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Only two lectures today, but they were packed. On 38/110 now. Learned about range, enumerate, and zip. Also learned how to accept user input, import libraries, and how to use 'in', min, & max. Oh, and list comprehensions. Decided to spend the time practicing these before moving on.

**Thoughts:**
Phew! Lots of new stuff! I'm going to have to spend more time practicing this tonight so I can take the assessment test tomorrow!

### Day 11: February 15, 2019

- Got home late, so not much done
- Added more functions to the tic-tac-toe project:
- tracks if current player is 'X' or 'O'
- tracks turns taken
- laid out a plan for the next few functions I need to add

- tested functions

**Thoughts:**
Sigh. I wish I could have gotten more done. Well, something is better than nothing.

### Day 12: February 16, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Woke up and made good progress on tic-tac-toe
- Got it sort of working.
- I refactored it, though. Need to test out the refactored code.

**Thoughts:**
I think I made good progress, but I was in a rush to get some coding in today, so I forgot to make regular commits and test code. smh. Trying to sort it all out afterwards is going to take up more time than it would have if I had just gone step-by-step. Sigh. Learning form my mistake and move forward.

### Day 13: February 17, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Made good progress with tic-tac-toe game
- It works!... with a 2 minor quirks and 1 major
- Will fix those tomorrow.
- Completed a couple of coding challenge using Python, Ruby, & JS


**Thoughts:**
Part of me wants to fix these issues today, but I know I'll feel down about not continuing to make progress on my review of the Flatiron curriculum's material.

### Day 14: February 18, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Finished building a basic two-player tic-tac-toe
- Repo link: https://github.com/AAM77/Tic_Tac_Toe_in_Python
- I'll introduce AI in a new repo once I learn more Python.
- Object Oriented Python up next.
- Completed a couple of challenges using Ruby, JS, and Python.

**Thoughts:**
Phew. It's done. Well, at least to the point where I am satisfied enough to move on. I took more than a few days, but I wasn't spending more than an hour or two per day on it. From that perspective, it isn't such bad progress.

### Day 15: February 19, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Continuing progress of lectures
- Completed 6 lectures. On 62/110 now.
- Studied object orientation in Python 3
- Completed a few coding challenges

**Thoughts:**
Wow. I made it to Python's object orientation section. It seriously improved my understanding of the 'self' keyword. Ruby kept a lot of things hidden so it seemed like 'magic', but Python seems to keep many things out in the open. This really helps clarify things because I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. It also provides at least some sort of glimpse as to what is happening in the background.

### Day 16: February 20, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Completed several coding challenges using Ruby, JS, and Python

**Thoughts:**
I was feeling in the mood to work on my coding skills with all three languages, so I decided to do each coding challenge using all three languages.

I fell asleep coding, though, so I didn't get to post it in a timely manner.
I was also coding everything online, so I still need to add the problems and my solutions to a separate file.

### Day 17: February 21, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Completed several coding challenges using Ruby, JS, and Python
- Studied lecture on inheritance and polymorphism

**Thoughts:**
Annoyed. I didn't get nearly as much done as I wanted. Frustrated. Spent yesterday running running errands instead of coding. Running behind on my main goal of completing the Flatiron curriculum.

### Day 18: February 22, 2019
**Today's Progress**:

    - how implement modules & packages
    - what if __init__ == "__main__" is for and how to use it
- Practiced what I learned

**Thoughts:**
Better progress than yesterday. I'm glad I switched to mornings for Python. It'll give me a chance to work on the challenge, get it out of the way, and then get to working on the Flatiron curriculum review.

### Day 23: February 28, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Worked on the Python project for a little over an hour.
- Created methods in the player and game classes of the Black Jack project.

### Day 24: March 1, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- One of those love-hate days.
- Coded all day, but ran into hurdles
- Methods for the Black Jack game refused to play nice with one another
- Had trouble with JS in a different project, again, but learned new techniques.


**Thoughts:**
Annoyed about Ajax, but I think there is just something wrong with the files in the folder. Oh, and I have mixed feelings about codelab, but that might just be because I don't know how to use it properly.

**Thoughts:**
None. I don't want to think. I just want to get things done.
