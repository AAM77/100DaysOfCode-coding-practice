| Bare Bones Plan: |
 ------------------

What do I want to happen?

1. User is greeted with an introductory screen

2. Asks user if s/he wants to be X or O

3. Assigns players

4. Prints an empty board

5. Asks user to choose a position (asks user for input)

6. When user chooses input, places the value in position and reprints the board

7. tracks turn

8. Until the last turn and the game board is filled:

9. Checks every turn if there are any winning combinations

11. if not last turn:
    - if winning combo, declare winner
    - if no winning combo, ask next player for input

  if last turn:
    - if winning combo, declare winner
    - if no winning combo, declare tie

If tie or winning combo, ask player if s/he wants to (y) repeat game or (n) end it.
